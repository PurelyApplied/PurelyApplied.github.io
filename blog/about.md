*I'm Lord Howard Hurtz.  Who th'\<beep\>'re you?!*

This is Patrick.  ![The cave beard](/img/cave_beard.jpg)

I'm a Software Engineer née Computer Scientist née Mathematician.
I'm [a doctor](https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/5831/), but not a *doctor* doctor.
I'm a Master of Computer Science, too, but I don't have a MasterClass, so what's the point?
I'm pretty okay ay [pinball](https://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=61457).

I'd say I'm overdue to have started a blog, but I slightly suspect that blogs are created on a Poisson distribution, so maybe I wasn't.

I'm probably going to use this space to talk a good bit about coding and metaprogramming tools.
Won't that be jolly fun?
