\subsection*{Developer experience}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \jobtitle{Software Engineer}
  \hspace{\fill}{ {Jan 2017 -- \verb!NOW=$(date +"%b %Y")!} }
  \workplace{Pivotal Software, Inc.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \vspace{.5em}
  \item {\textbf{Highlights:}}
  \item\quad Developed and maintained continuous-integration infrastructure,
    including migration of that \\ infrastructure from AWS to GCP
  \item\quad Expanded scope and improved granularity of security permissions for all cluster operations
  % \item\quad Parallelized \verb!precheckin! testing suite, reducing execution time $\sim$3 hours to $\sim$45 minutes
  \item\quad Redesigned and rewrote GemFire's \ttt{gradle} build to respect modularity,
    with focus on build\\ parallelization and incrementalization,
    clean delineation of code ownership and testing boundaries between supporting projects,
    and maintaining artifact expectation for downstream projects.

\subsection*{Strong opinions, held}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A problem does not need to become costly before its solution has value.
  \item A product withers on the vine when its build system is broken.\opinionsPar
    A responsible developer know how it works.
  \item Tests form the contract of permissible product behavior.\opinionsPar
    Product confidence necessitates test confidence.
  \item \gah{Perfect} is certainly the enemy \gah{good},\opinionsPar
    but \gah{good enough} will be the death of them both.
  \item A responsible developer seeks out the full usefulness of their tools.\opinionsPar
    Your IDE will help you if you learn how to ask it.
%  \item Agile has some good ideas, but it has bad ones, too.\opinionsPar
%    If you're always pivoting, you're not driving your epic to completion.
