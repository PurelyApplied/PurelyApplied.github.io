\section*{A Summary of Me as a Developer}

I'm a polyglot.  I love learning and delight in having confience that I've chosen the right tool for a given job.

\subsection*{Language and Tool proficiencies}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fluent and well-spoken:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Java JDK 8
    \item Python (both 2 and 3, with \ttt{python3} preferred)
    \item The Gradle build tool
    \item \ttt{git}, because of course \ttt{git}
    \item Likewise Linux, because of course.
    \item \ttt{emacs} forever.
    \item Concourse continuous integration, and consequently also YAML and Jinja2.
    \item The JetBrains family at large, but predominantly IntelliJ and PyCharm, as one might expected from the above
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \item Conversational:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Java JDK 11 and Jigsaw modules.
    \item Docker.  Containers are so hot right now.  Also they make throwing something onto GCP trivially easy.
    \item AWS and GCP, predominantly as vehicles for continuous integration testing, as well as personal project hosting.
    \item \ttt{vim}, because as much as I prefer \ttt{emacs}, I'm not a zealot and will use the tools available to me.
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \item Out of practice but happy to relearn:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item C / C++, Perl
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \item Neophyte:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item R, Go, Matlab, Gnuplot, Django
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Strong opinions, {weakly} held}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A problem does not need to become costly before its solution has value.
  \item A product withers on the vine when its build system is broken.  A responsible developer know how it works.  An excellent developer improves it.
  \item Tests form the contract of permissible product behavior.  Product confidence cannot exist without test confidence.
  \item A responsible developer seeks out the full usefulness of their tools.  (Your IDE can do that for you.  Let it.)
  \item Agile has some good ideas, but it has bad ones, too.  If you're always pivoting, you're not finishing your epics.  Building around individuals isn't scalable.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Other Points of Interest}
\begin{itemize}
\item Author of \href{https://www.reddit.com/user/roll_one_for_me}{
  \ttt{/u/roll\_one\_for\_me}}, table-roller for /r/DnDBehindTheScreen and
  related subreddits.  The bot is GCP-hosted and deployed via Docker.
\item Doctoral thesis, titled {\em On the Scalable Parallelization of Network Diffusion Models}, is available
  at the University of Iowa's Institutional Repository:  \url{https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/5831/}
