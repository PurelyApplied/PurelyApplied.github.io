  \begin{itemize}
  \vspace{.5em}
  \item {\textbf{Highlights}}
  \item\quad Developed and maintained continuous-integration infrastructure,\\
    including migration of that infrastructure from AWS to GCP
  \item\quad Expanded scope and granularity of security permissions for all cluster operations
  \item\quad Parallelized \verb!precheckin! testing suite, reducing execution time $\sim$3 hours to $\sim$45 minutes
  \item\quad Redesigned and rewrote GemFire's \ttt{gradle} build to respect modularity,\\
    allow build parallelization and incrementalization,
    and cleanly delineate ownership and testing boundaries between supporting projects,
    all the while maintaining artifact expectation for downstream projects.

\section*{A Summary of Me as a Developer}

I'm a polyglot.  I love learning and delight in having confience that I've chosen the right tool for a given job.

\subsection*{Language and Tool Proficiencies}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fluent and well-spoken:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Java JDK 8
    \item Python (both 2 and 3)
    \item The Gradle build tool
    \item \ttt{git}, because of course \ttt{git}
    \item Linux, \ttt{bash}, and \ttt{emacs}
    \item Concourse continuous integration, and as a tangential consequence, Jinja2
    \item The JetBrains family at large, but predominantly IntelliJ and PyCharm, as one might expected from the above
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \item Conversational:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Java JDK 11 and Jigsaw modules.
    \item Docker.  So hot right now.
    \item AWS and GCP, predominantly as vehicles for previously mentioned continuous integration and personal projects.
    \item \ttt{vim}, because as much as I prefer \ttt{emacs}, I use the tools available to me.
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \item Out of practice but happy to relearn:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item C / C++, Perl, Matlab, Gnuplot
  \end{itemize}
  %
  % \item Neophyte:
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item R, Go, Django
  % \end{itemize}
  % \item And probably some others, because who can really enumerate everything they know?
\end{itemize}

\newcommand{\opinionsPar}{\par\vspace{-.3em}\quad}

\subsection*{Strong opinions, held}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A problem does not need to become costly before its solution has value.
  \item A product withers on the vine when its build system is broken.\opinionsPar
    A responsible developer know how it works.
  \item Tests form the contract of permissible product behavior.\opinionsPar
    Product confidence necessitates test confidence.
  \item A responsible developer seeks out the full usefulness of their tools.\opinionsPar
    Your IDE will help you if you learn how to ask it.
%  \item Agile has some good ideas, but it has bad ones, too.\opinionsPar
%    If you're always pivoting, you're not driving your epic to completion.
\end{itemize}
