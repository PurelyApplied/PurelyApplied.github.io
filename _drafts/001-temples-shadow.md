North along the western coast sits a large coding and fishing village.
The waters bustle at all hours.
Skiffs scurry near the shore carrying lightweight packets,
  while the dockers of the Seven-Spokes Guilde pack and unpack isolated containers.
These in turn are loaded into great deployed onto the great sea ships

Near enough the docks that you can hear the din of the longshoremen,
 but far enough that you can still hold a conversation,
 sits a small but popular tavern.
Within, youngsters crowd around Elágazás.

"Tell us a story!" the clamored.
    "Tell us about the Guild of the Broken Chord!" one piped.
"Tell us of the time before the great cloudships!" one trilled.
"Tell us why they abandoned the temple," one pleaded with wide eyes.
Elágazás smiled sadly and noded.

"Once, there was a [great temple](http://thecodelesscode.com/contents).
The monks of many clans coded in those halls,
  supporting the Emperor's inventories and online shopping carts.
Masters of every stripe imparted deep wisdom and harsh correction to apprentices and junior developers.

Elágazás sighed in happy memory, staring off into the middle distance.
A wistful smile played at her lips.

"But what happened to them, El?"

She waver her hand dismissively.
"They went away.
 The clans reorganized.
 Some monks were unhappy in their new positions, and they left.
 Those that stayed became Agile.
 They shifted priorities.
 After Their methods were deprecated, their servers and services turned down.
 People still come and go, but the masters haven't been in years.

"But so great was the temple that even in their absence, the masters offer us their wisdom.
 The legacy of the Temple of the Morning Brass Gong makes us all again novices.
 And just as we tell novices, this is how a legacy is continued.
 
"Fork. Commit. Merge."
