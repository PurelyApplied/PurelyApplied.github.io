**tl;dr: I would happily pay plat per query for a machine-readable, up-to-date account state.**

### I have no memory of this place.

I hopped back into Warframe yesterday.
I hadn't logged in since a bit after Update 27, but I've wandered in and out of Warframe for a long time.
The in-game stats say I've clocked 433 hours,
 and my KeePass history and Steam Achievements suggest I started Q1 2014.

This time around, I'd been away for a few months.
I played a while after Railjack came out, enough so that the Update 27.2 refunds from March were still waiting for me.
And this time, like every time I get back into it after months away, I was immediately met with the same thought.

*What the hell had I been doing..?*

Looking through my arsenal, I have a rank zero Loki.
Oh, that's right, I wanted to remmaster the starter frames, since I'd sold them for space back when I was a broke student.

I have two of the tree Trinity pieces ready to build...
Oh, right, I needed more Animo Nav Beacons before I could finishing that frame.

I had Hildryn's neuropics, but not the other bits...
I never did rep up with Little Duck.
I guess I could do the orb mothers.

Oh, right, the Parazon is a thing now.
I have five Parazon Mods, but I never did start my Kuva Lich.
I had wanted to collect all eight mods before I started my Lich,
 because I wanted to be able to kill my Lich without being blocked by that.

And then I felt a bit overwhelmed, and I had the second thought that I have every time I come back to - or indeed right before I stop playing - Warframe.

*This is a solvable problem.*

### Ain't nobody got time f'that.

At some point, I became an adult with more disposable income than time.
I am part of a demographic on which free-to-play games seek to capitalize.
I really just want to fly around and be a silly space ninja.
I want to focus on the primary gameplay loop, and let someone else figure out where that should happen in a way that satisfies the secondary and tertiary growth curves.
Unfortunately, I'm also a consciousness trapped in a brain, and it's impossible to not feel like I'm taking an opportunity loss if I'm not also raising my mastery, grinding resources, or building rep.

This is a solvable problem.
If I had my account state in a machine-readable format, it would be a weekend project to integrate with the already-existing heaps of data aggregated by other developers like [WFCD](https://github.com/WFCD).
At the push of a button, PseudoOrdis could produce *Some Short-Term Achievable Objectives*.
What items am I close to completing?
What resources am I missing?
Where do I get those?

*Suggestion:
 Run your Neo Z2 relics for the Mesa Prime Blueprint, whose components you already have.  With your 6 relics, you have a at least a 74% chance to acquire the blueprint, provided you refine to Radiant."*

Someone better at front-end could hook that up into a web app.
Maybe it could be a new tab on the [WarframeHub](https://hub.warframestat.us/). 
I could cross-reference my inventory with a friend's and see that we're both missing melee stances that the other has in duplicate.
We could see a mutually-beneficial set of relics to run with each other.
We could get back to playing the game and spend less time on optimizing it.

### Shut up and take my money!

I'm sitting on over 2,000 plat.
I buy inventory slots anytime I need them, and I bought a couple focus lenses when I upgraded from Saryn to Saryn Prime.
I'm not really inclined to trade, because it's not fun.
I don't rush my foundry, and I don't really care about cosmetics.
Mostly, I just want to bullet jump and go pew-pew-pew at the bad mans.

I am looking for a place to spend my plat.
If I could get my account info at 5p per query, I would probably do it every single day that I play.
At 15p per query, I'd probably do it once or twice per week, and rely on third party tools to allow me to check things off as completed.

I would enjoy the game more.
I would feel less overwhelmed by the absolute mountain of content you've put in the game.
Your community would continue to build rich tooling around your game.
I would expect overall engagement, retention, and spending to go up.
Perhaps not by an enormous amount, but it still sounds like a win.

I understand this is a significant ask.
Exposing and securing a new service is A Big Deal.
I'm under no illusion that it would be the flip of a switch or that you'd want to expose much of your internals.
The logistics of it would be hairy.

But just so it's on record: I'd happily pay you for it.
