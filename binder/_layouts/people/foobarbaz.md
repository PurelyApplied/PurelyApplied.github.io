So, [go-flow-levee](https://github.com/google/go-flow-levee) exists now.
It's got a long way to go yet in terms of general usability as we disentangle it from some Google-specific application, but I'm pretty stoked about it.

For those who don't know...

> levee (n): an embankment built to prevent the overflow of a river.

Certainly not to be confused with the taxing homonym *levy*.

I grew up in the Mississippi Valley, in Davenport, Iowa, which is the booger that hangs off MIMAL's nose.
My dad is just about to finish up his third and last six-year term serving on the Davenport Levee Improvement Commission.
I'm a little sad at how long it took me to come up with the name, but then again, naming is [the second hard thing](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/220).
