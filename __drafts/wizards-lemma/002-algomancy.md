A jail cell is an uncomfortable place for a child.
They are uncomfortable by design, of course, entirely agnostic to the age of the - shall we say - resident.
The morning chill had not yet abated, occasionally gusting through the barred windows.
The stone walls and dirt floor leeched what little warmth the room held.

The lonely guard was at least as uncomfortable as the child.
He was not accustomed to minding children, being much more habituated to drunks and petty criminals.
Compounding that, rumor whispered that the boy was a wierdling.
Magic was something for the cities, not a village barely big enough to warrant a holding cell.
