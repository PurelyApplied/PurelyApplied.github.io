North along the western coast sits a large coding and fishing village.
The waters bustle at all hours.
Skiffs hurry along the shore carrying lightweight packets,
 while isolated containers are loaded and unloaded by the Seventh Spoke Sailors.
Near enough the docks that you can hear the din of the longshoremen,
 but far enough that you can still hold a conversation,
 a storyteller El치goz치s draws a small crowd of youngsters.
"Tell us what happened to the abandoned temple," one says, and the storyteller nods.

Once, there was a great temple.
Monks of many clans coded in those halls,
  supporting the Emperor's inventories and online shopping carts.
Masters of every stripe imparted wisdom to apprentices and younger developers.

El치goz치s sighed in happy memory, staring off into the middle distance.
A wistful smile played at her lips.

"But what happened to them, El?"

Returning her focus to the present, the smile fled.
She waver her hand dismissively.
"They went away.
 The clans reorganized.
 They became Agile, shifted priorities.
 Their methods were deprecated, their servers decommissioned.

"But so great was the temple that even this offers us wisdom.
 The legacy of the Temple of the Morning Brass Gong makes us all again novices.
 And just as we tell novices, this is how a legacy is continued.
 
"Fork, commit, and merge."
